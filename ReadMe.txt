# Flasky Birdboard
This is a rebuild of a laravel application called [birdboard](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard) using Flask, SqlAlchemy, Docker and eventually React (will probably finish backend first though). 

I also plan to have a series of blog posts to document it in the future, and will post the link here when it is up.

In order to run the project, download it and run:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
